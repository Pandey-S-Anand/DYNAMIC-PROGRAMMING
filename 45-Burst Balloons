//Improved Approach

/**
 * To apply recursion or dynamic programming, we need to break the problem into smaller, independent subproblems.
 * In the "Burst Balloons" problem, the objective is to maximize the coins obtained by bursting balloons in an optimal sequence.
 * However, if we attempt to solve the problem by bursting each balloon as the first one, the subproblems created are not independent.
 * This is because the number of coins collected from bursting a balloon depends on its neighboring balloons, and these neighbors
 * change dynamically as other balloons are burst. This interdependency of subproblems makes it challenging to apply a straightforward
 * recursive approach when considering each balloon as the first to burst.
 *
 * The critical insight for solving the "Burst Balloons" problem using recursion or dynamic programming is to change the way we think
 * about the problem. Instead of bursting balloons in the first-to-last order, we reverse the approach and consider each balloon as the
 * last one to burst within a subarray.
 *
 * When a balloon is chosen as the last to burst in its subarray, its neighbors are fixed based on the boundaries of the subarray.
 * This makes the calculation of coins straightforward. Additionally, the two resulting subarrays ([start, ..., i-1] and [i+1, ..., end])
 * become completely independent of each other. This independence allows the problem to be broken down into smaller, non-overlapping
 * subproblems, making it suitable for recursion and dynamic programming.

Note :

Input: nums = [3,1,5,8] 
Output: 167 
Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> [] 
coins = 3*1*5 + 3*5*8 + 1*3*8 + 1*8*1 = 167 

Suppose we know the last balloon to be burst is 8, and the second last is 3. 
Now we are determining the third-last balloon. Suppose we choose 5 as the third-last balloon to burst.

Why is 3 the neighbor on the left of 5 and not 1?

Explanation:
- Since we already know 8 will be the last balloon and 3 will be the second last, 
  this means 1 and 5 must have already been burst earlier (as the first or second balloons to burst).
- Therefore, when evaluating for the third-last balloon, its neighbors at that step are dynamically updated.
  At this point, the only remaining neighbors of 5 are 3 and 8.
- This is why 3 is considered the neighbor on the left, and 8 is the neighbor on the right.
- Working backwards from the last balloon helps us know the exact neighbors at each step.
- The neighbors are determined dynamically based on the balloons that have already been burst, rather than 
  the initial configuration of the array.

This approach ensures that at each step of the recursive/dynamic programming solution, we correctly account 
for the current state of the neighbors as the array of remaining balloons shrinks.
